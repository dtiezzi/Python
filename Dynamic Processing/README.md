# Dynamic programming

Here I demonstrate a pratical example how dynamic programming can speed up the prossesing time.
</br>
I used a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence in a for loop from 0 to the number the user wants to.
</br>
There are two python script. One using the Fibonacci function in a recursive way `times.py`, and other in a dynamic way `timesDym.py`.
</br> 
You have to install the matplotlib package before running them. 
</br>
Take a look how different is the processing time as you increase the number in the Fibonacci sequence.
